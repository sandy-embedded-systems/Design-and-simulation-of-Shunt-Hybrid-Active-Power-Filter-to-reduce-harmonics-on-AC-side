* Follow the steps:
1. Download MATLAB/Simulink with 2009a version.
2. Download shunthybrid.mdl file .
3. Opne MATLAB and open the .mdl file
4. Run/simulate the model
5. You can observe the scope views in outputs.double clock on outputs you see the scopes
6. Double clock on controller to see the controlling simulation model for the project.
7. Learn in detail about each component of project and its role in it.
