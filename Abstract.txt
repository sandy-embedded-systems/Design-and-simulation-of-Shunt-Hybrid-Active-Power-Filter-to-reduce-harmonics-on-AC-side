This paper presents D-Q Synchronous Reference Frame (SRF) current control method in order to generate the required reference current for 3-phase 4-wire shunt hybrid
active power filter (SHAPF) to solve harmonics problem in power system network. Here, the passive elements of SHAPF have been used for compensation of reactive 
power and to eliminate the lower order harmonics and the active part have been used for the higher order harmonics. A modified phase lock loop (PLL) has been used 
to handle the double frequency element of non-ideal voltages. All the simulation for achieving the goal have been conducted in MATLAB/SIMULINK environment for ideal 
and unbalanced mains voltage conditions. From the simulation results it has been seen that the implementation of proposed D-Q SRF based SHAPF resulted in reduced THD 
in the power system network both in balanced and unbalanced conditions.

Keywords: Phase Lock Loop, PI controller, SRF, THD, SHAPF.
